			<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
				<p>I am an experienced graphic designer, turned teacher, who is again turning her 25 years’ plus experience into a new career, as a UX designer and web site developer.  My artistic abilities drive my love for design, while my curiosity is never satisfied, hence I am two thirds through a Psychology degree I started after qualifying as a teacher.</p>
				<p>Having assisted children with special learning needs for the past few years, I am now looking at ways of making technology accessible to all, through smart design.  I learnt coding during 2022 and plan to complete my full-stack developer training in 2023.</p>
				<p>Who knows where this new journey will take me?  Having reinvented myself before, I am excited to see what I am able to do with my newly acquired skills and the multitude of opportunities a career as a developer offers.</p>
			<h3>SKILLS</h3>
			<p><span>GRAPHIC DESIGN</span> I am a trained graphical designer, with twenty years’ experience, including six years as an art director in print media.</p>
			<p><span>TEACHING</span> A qualified teacher, I spent most of the past three years teaching special needs learners at primary school level, where I was privileged to see the life-transforming moment when struggling youngsters master basic reading skills after several years’ perseverance.</p>
